## Windows Keylogger

Build the solution to gain a Windows keylogger that (currently) bypasses Defender. This can be used to pivot around and enumerate a network or escalate privileges once an host or workstation has been initially compromised. By default, it will write the pressed keys to the current directory the keylogger is run under the name `log.txt`, so you may want to get creative as to the name and location you store the output.
